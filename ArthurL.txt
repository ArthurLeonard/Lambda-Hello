Hi, my name is Arthur. 


Radagast the Brown, Radagast the Simple, and Radagast the Fool are three words that describe me. 


My favorite hobby is conversing with birds. My greatest concern in this world is with the olvar and kelvar. I am wiser than any man in all things concerning herbs and beasts. I dwell in Rhosgobel by the Vale of Anduin. I am never a traveller unless driven by great need.
