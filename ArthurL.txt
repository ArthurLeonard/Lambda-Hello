Hi, my name is Arthur. 


Male, human, mortal are three words that describe me. 


My favorite hobby is learning. This manifests itself in different ways. I have a passion for traveling, cooking, mathematics, chess, logic, sports, world music, different cultures, different ways of thinking, spending time with anyone and anything with more intelligence than me. I believe that learning, like everything else in life, needs to be shared in order to be fulfilling.
